## Summary

The patient, a healthy 25-year-old engineering student who works part-time as a postman, presents with sharp chest pain over the heart area lasting a few seconds, starting three days ago. The pain worsens with coughing or lying down and improves when leaning forward. The pain sometimes radiates to the neck and rates 6/10 in intensity. There are no other symptoms such as shortness of breath, dizziness, palpitations, or viral symptoms currently, though the patient had the flu last week. There is no history of medical conditions, medications (except occasional Tylenol), allergies, surgeries, smoking, or drug use. The patient is worried about a heart attack due to a recent family historyâ€”his father died of a heart attack two weeks ago. The clinician plans to perform an ECG and possibly blood tests to evaluate the heart function and reassures the patient to avoid excessive worry until results are available.
