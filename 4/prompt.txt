Task: Expert Code Review Analysis using Role Prompting

You are conducting a comprehensive code review of the following JavaScript/TypeScript function that processes user data. Analyze this code from three distinct expert perspectives to identify issues and provide actionable improvements.

**Code Under Review:**
```javascript
function processUserData(data: any) {
  var users = [];

  for (var i = 0; i < data.length; i++) {
    var user = {
      id: data[i].id,
      name: data[i].name,
      email: data[i].email,
      active: data[i].status === 'active' ? true : false
    };
    users.push(user);
  }
  console.log("Processed " + users.length + " users");
  return users;
}

function saveToDatabase(users) {
  //TODO: Implement database connection
  var success = true;
  return success;
}
```

**Context:** This code is part of a web application backend that receives user data from an API endpoint and processes it before storing in a database.

## Analysis Instructions:

Analyze the above code sequentially from each expert role below. Focus specifically on the issues present in this code and provide concrete solutions.

### Role 1: Senior JavaScript Developer
**Your Background:** 7+ years developing production JavaScript/Node.js applications, expert in modern ES6+/TypeScript practices

**Analysis Focus for THIS Code:**
- Examine the mixed TypeScript/JavaScript syntax (`data: any` with `var` declarations)
- Evaluate the loop-based array building approach vs modern alternatives
- Assess error handling for the data processing pipeline
- Review function design and potential refactoring opportunities
- Identify TypeScript improvements for better type safety

**Provide:** Specific code improvements addressing the ES5/TypeScript inconsistencies and suggesting modern JavaScript patterns for this exact function.

### Role 2: Application Security Analyst  
**Your Background:** Specialist in web application security, focused on data processing vulnerabilities and API security

**Analysis Focus for THIS Code:**
- Examine input validation risks with the `data: any` parameter
- Assess potential injection vulnerabilities through direct property access (`data[i].id`, etc.)
- Evaluate information disclosure risks from the console.log statement
- Review the TODO database connection for security implications
- Identify data sanitization needs for user inputs (id, name, email)

**Provide:** Specific security vulnerabilities in this code and concrete mitigation strategies with code examples.

### Role 3: Performance Optimization Expert
**Your Background:** Specialist in JavaScript performance optimization, memory management, and scalability

**Analysis Focus for THIS Code:**
- Evaluate the efficiency of the for-loop with array.push() pattern
- Assess memory allocation strategy for the users array
- Examine scalability concerns if data array contains thousands of records  
- Review the synchronous processing approach for potential bottlenecks
- Analyze the database interaction pattern for performance implications

**Provide:** Specific performance improvements for this exact code, including optimized versions and scalability recommendations.
