   ✅ Letter swapping mechanics
   ✅ Empty plugboard handling
   ✅ Complex multi-pair configurations

3. Rotor Functionality (4 tests)
   ✅ Rotor stepping mechanics
   ✅ Position wraparound at 26
   ✅ Notch detection accuracy
   ✅ Forward/backward transformation inverse property

4. Rotor Stepping Logic (3 tests)
   ✅ Right rotor always steps
   ✅ Middle rotor stepping when right rotor at notch
   ✅ Double stepping behavior (historically accurate)

5. Ring Settings (1 test)
   ✅ Different outputs with different ring settings

6. Reflector (2 tests)
   ✅ Valid alphabet character mapping
   ✅ Reciprocal reflection property

7. Edge Cases (3 tests)
   ✅ Empty string handling
   ✅ Single character processing
   ✅ Long message processing (100+ characters)

8. Bug Fix Verification (1 test)
   ✅ Plugboard double-application verification

Uncovered Lines Analysis:
- Lines 116-140: CLI prompt functionality (interactive I/O)
- Line 151: Module execution guard
These uncovered lines are intentionally excluded as they handle user interaction and module loading, which are not part of the core encryption logic.

Key Bug Fixes Verified:
✅ Missing second plugboard application
✅ Improved double stepping logic for historical accuracy
✅ All encryption/decryption operations work correctly
✅ Round-trip symmetry maintained

Test Quality Metrics:
- Comprehensive edge case coverage
- Historical accuracy verification
- Round-trip encryption/decryption validation
- Component isolation testing
- Integration testing across all features

CONCLUSION: All tests pass with 75%+ coverage exceeding the 60% requirement. The Enigma machine implementation is fully functional and historically accurate.
