1. Requirement Decomposition:

a) Millions of users:
   - Storage capacity: >10TB data volume
   - Concurrency: >100k simultaneous connections
   - Latency: <100ms response time requirement
   - Consistency: Eventual consistency acceptable
   - Partitioning: Horizontal sharding mandatory

b) Data types (profiles, posts, connections):
   - Structured data: user profiles (fixed schema)
   - Semi-structured data: posts (variable content)
   - Graph relationships: user connections (many-to-many)
   - Schema flexibility: evolving data models required

c) High read speed priority:
   - Query optimization: index-heavy strategy
   - Read replicas: distributed read architecture
   - Caching integration: multi-tier caching
   - Data locality: geographic distribution

d) 80/20 read/write ratio:
   - Read-optimized storage engines
   - Write performance secondary priority
   - Read scaling priority over write consistency
   - Bulk write operations acceptable

e) Horizontal scaling capability:
   - Auto-sharding mechanisms
   - Linear performance scaling
   - Multi-region distribution
   - No single points of failure

2. Database Type Evaluation:

a) Relational SQL (PostgreSQL, MySQL):
   + ACID compliance, mature tooling, complex queries
   - Vertical scaling limitations, sharding complexity, read replica lag

b) Document NoSQL (MongoDB, CouchDB):
   + Horizontal scaling, flexible schema, read optimization, aggregation pipelines
   - Eventual consistency, complex join operations, memory requirements

c) Graph NoSQL (Neo4j, ArangoDB):
   + Optimal relationship traversal, natural social graph modeling, complex pattern matching
   - Horizontal scaling complexity, limited read optimization, niche expertise required

d) Key-Value NoSQL (Redis, DynamoDB):
   + Ultra-fast reads, simple scaling, caching integration, low latency
   - Limited query complexity, data modeling constraints, no complex relationships

e) Column-Family NoSQL (Cassandra, HBase):
   + Massive write throughput, linear scaling, high availability, time-series optimization
   - Limited query flexibility, eventual consistency, complex operations

3. Requirement-Solution Mapping:

Social platform specific alignment:
- User connections modeling: Graph > Document > Column-Family > Relational > Key-Value
- Read optimization: Key-Value > Document > Column-Family > Relational > Graph
- Horizontal scaling: Column-Family > Document > Key-Value > Graph > Relational
- Data modeling flexibility: Document > Graph > Key-Value > Column-Family > Relational

4. Synthesis and Scoring:

Weighted scoring (Read performance: 40%, Scalability: 30%, Data modeling: 20%, Operational complexity: 10%):

- MongoDB (Document): 8.4/10
  (Read: 8/10, Scalability: 9/10, Data modeling: 9/10, Operations: 7/10)

- Cassandra (Column-Family): 7.6/10
  (Read: 7/10, Scalability: 10/10, Data modeling: 6/10, Operations: 5/10)

- PostgreSQL (Relational): 6.8/10
  (Read: 7/10, Scalability: 5/10, Data modeling: 7/10, Operations: 9/10)

- Neo4j (Graph): 6.5/10
  (Read: 6/10, Scalability: 6/10, Data modeling: 10/10, Operations: 6/10)

- Redis (Key-Value): 6.2/10
  (Read: 10/10, Scalability: 7/10, Data modeling: 3/10, Operations: 8/10)

5. Technical Justification:

Selected solution: MongoDB + Redis hybrid architecture

Step-by-step requirement addressing:

a) Millions of users → MongoDB sharding with 4+ replica sets distributes load horizontally

b) Complex data types → Document model natively handles profiles (structured), posts (semi-structured), and connections (embedded/referenced)

c) High read speed → Read preference routing to secondaries + Redis caching layer achieves <50ms response times

d) 80/20 read/write ratio → Read replicas scale independently of write operations, Redis handles frequent read patterns

e) Horizontal scaling → Auto-sharding via mongos routers + Redis cluster provides linear scaling

Implementation strategy:
- Primary storage: MongoDB with zone-based sharding
- Cache layer: Redis cluster for session and frequently accessed data
- Sharding keys: Users (hashed _id), Posts (compound user_id + timestamp), Connections (range-based user_id)
- Monitoring: MongoDB Compass + Redis monitoring for performance optimization

This hybrid solution optimally addresses social platform requirements through MongoDB's flexible data modeling and horizontal scaling combined with Redis's ultra-fast caching capabilities.
