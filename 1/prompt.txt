Role: Senior Database Systems Architect

Task: Select optimal database solution for social platform using systematic Chain-of-Thought reasoning methodology.

Requirements:
- Social platform: millions of users
- Data types: user profiles, posts, user connections
- Performance: high read speed priority
- Operation ratio: 80% reads, 20% writes
- Scalability: horizontal scaling capability required

Analysis Framework:
1. Requirement decomposition: Analyze each requirement's technical implications for database characteristics (storage capacity, concurrency, latency, consistency, partitioning)

2. Database type evaluation: Assess five database categories against requirements:
   - Relational SQL (PostgreSQL, MySQL)
   - Document NoSQL (MongoDB, CouchDB)
   - Graph NoSQL (Neo4j, ArangoDB)
   - Key-Value NoSQL (Redis, DynamoDB)
   - Column-Family NoSQL (Cassandra, HBase)

3. Requirement-solution mapping: For each database type, determine specific alignment with social platform needs (user connections modeling, read optimization, horizontal scaling)

4. Synthesis and scoring: Rank database types based on weighted criteria (read performance: 40%, scalability: 30%, data modeling: 20%, operational complexity: 10%)

5. Technical justification: Provide step-by-step explanation demonstrating how selected database addresses each requirement with specific implementation strategies

Output format: Structured analysis with quantified assessments and clear reasoning chain from requirements to final database selection decision.
